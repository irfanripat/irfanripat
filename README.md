### Assalamualaikum, Irfan here! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px"> 

I'm a Native Android Engineer with 1+ year of experience using often `Kotlin` and sometimes `Java` to build android apps.


Currently, learn and work at Waresix as Android Engineer Intern, contribute to develop new feature called 'Learning Center' on [Waresix Driver App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.waresix.freight.driver), and currently working with team to develop new Waresix App such as [Waresix FE App V.3](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.waresix.wos.fe) and [Waresix Transporter App V.3](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.waresix.wos.transporter).

Due to regulations of the company I currently work at (this is also the reason why my personal account doesn't have much activity ðŸ¥²), [I have another GitHub account](https://github.com/iripat)
